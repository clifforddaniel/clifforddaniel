## 🚧 Projects

#### Shipping Label Automation Tool
I built a Python-based [shipping label automation tool](https://github.com/clifforddaniel/shipping-label-app) using OpenPyXL and tkinter. It was built for a small business and automates their shipping label creation using Excel spreadsheet inputs, reducing labor time by over 90%.

#### School projects
Many of my university projects (like Spring Boot app and C++ Student Management System app) are stored in **private repositories** due to academic integrity policies at WGU.

If you're a recruiter or collaborator interested in viewing those projects, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-clifford97/) or email me at [clifford.daniel97@gmail.com](mailto:clifford.daniel97@gmail.com).

#### Personal Projects
Some of the [scripts and tools](https://github.com/clifforddaniel/personal-projects) I use in my workflow. Mostly small-scale, but often useful or expandable.


#### Learning Projects
I'm always learning. You can explore some of my personal learning projects in this [Learning Projects repo](https://github.com/clifforddaniel/learning-projects).
